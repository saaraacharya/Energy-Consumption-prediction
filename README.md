The description of data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

Attribute Information: 1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss

3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

# Machine-Leaning: LSTM Data Preparation and feature engineering
* I have applied recurrent nueral network (LSTM) which is best suited for time-seriers and sequential problem. This approach is the best if we have large data.
* I have framed the supervised learning problem as predicting the Global_active_power at the current time (t) given the Global_active_power measurement and other features at the prior time step.Â¶
